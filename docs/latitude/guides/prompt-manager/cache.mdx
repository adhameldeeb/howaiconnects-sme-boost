Latitude implements a caching system for prompt responses to optimize performance and reduce costs. This guide explains how caching works and when it's applied.

## How Caching Works

When you execute a prompt, Latitude automatically caches the response if certain conditions are met. The cache key is generated based on:

- The workspace ID
- The prompt configuration
- The conversation context

This means that identical prompts with the same parameters in the same workspace will return cached results.

## Cache Conditions

Caching is only applied when:

- The temperature is set to 0 or not specified
- The prompt execution is successful

This is because non-zero temperatures introduce randomness in the responses, making caching less useful as each execution is intended to be unique.

## Benefits

Caching provides several advantages:

- **Reduced Costs**: Cached responses don't consume additional API tokens
- **Faster Response Times**: Cached results are returned immediately
- **Consistency**: Identical prompts always return the same response

## Cache Duration

Currently, cached responses are stored indefinitely. However, you can force a fresh execution by:

- Modifying any part of the prompt configuration
- Changing the conversation context
- Using a non-zero temperature
