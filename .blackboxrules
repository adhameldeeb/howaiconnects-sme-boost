# BLACKBOX RULES for SME Boost Platform Development

# Purpose:
# Ensure consistent use of exact boilerplate templates for styles, themes, color palettes, assets, and routing.

# Rules:
# 1. Always use the exact boilerplate template repositories for admin, user, and backend dashboards.
# 2. Maintain the original styles, themes, color palettes, assets, and routing structures from the boilerplates.
# 3. Any customization must preserve the integrity of the boilerplate design system.
# 4. Shared utilities, styles, and assets should be managed in dedicated packages within the Turbo Repo structure.
# 5. Follow a pre-planned project structure to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth integration.
# 6. Document all major changes and customizations in the project documentation.
# 7. Regularly review adherence to these rules during development phases.
